- **Output:** Ready-to-use development environment with all tools configured

#### **setup-flutter-env** (Enhanced - Intelligent Setup)
Interactive environment setup with critical thinking about development preferences and compatibility.
- **Use when:** Developer needs setup guidance, wants recommendations on dev container vs local, needs platform choice help
- **Covers:** Pre-setup discovery questions, compatibility analysis, pros/cons matrix, feasibility research, setup decisions
- **Output:** Optimized setup choice tailored to developer's constraints and preferences

### 🔍 Discovery & Learning

#### **search-new-flutter-skills**
Discover new, useful Flutter/Dart skills and patterns from the internet.
- **Use when:** Developer wants to explore emerging tools/practices, expand toolkit, stay current with ecosystem
- **Covers:** Internet research, skill evaluation, local integration, continuous learning
- **Output:** Link to new skill, option to create it locally, integration with your capabilities
- **Impact:** Automatically grows your skill set with valuable new techniques

### 🧹 Code Quality & Maintenance

#### **pr-prep**
Comprehensive code cleanup and preparation for pull requests.
- **Use when:** Code is ready for review, need to ensure quality standards before PR
- **Covers:** Baseline verification (dart fix, flutter analyze, flutter test), fix failures, cleanup code, expand test coverage
- **Output:** Clean, tested, well-documented code ready for PR
- **MCP Tools:** dart_fix, dart_format, analyze_files, run_tests

#### **single-file-test-coverage**
Improve test coverage for specific files with comprehensive unit tests.
- **Use when:** Targeting low-coverage files, need edge case testing, want measurable coverage improvements
- **Covers:** Identifying low-coverage files, writing comprehensive tests, edge case coverage, mocking dependencies
- **Output:** Improved coverage with X% → Y% progress report
- **MCP Tools:** run_tests, analyze_files, dart_format, dart_fix

### 🚀 Code Modernization

#### **migrate-to-modern-dart-features**
Modernize code to Dart 3+ language features for improved readability.
- **Use when:** Code uses older Dart patterns, want to apply modern syntax, improve code conciseness
- **Covers:** Pattern transformations (switch expressions, pattern matching, records), Dart 3+ features
- **Constraints:** Max 50-line changes, no behavior changes, all tests must pass
- **Output:** Modernized code with same functionality, improved readability
- **MCP Tools:** dart_format, analyze_files, run_tests, dart_fix

### 🧪 Testing & Runtime

#### **flutter-control-and-screenshot**
End-to-end testing and screenshot capture via Flutter Driver.
- **Use when:** Need to test app interactions, capture screenshots for documentation, perform E2E testing
- **Covers:** flutter_driver setup, app control (tap, input, scroll, wait), screenshot capture, web screenshot strategies
- **Output:** Verified app interactions, captured screenshots, test coverage for UI flows
- **MCP Tools:** launch_app, connect_dart_tooling_daemon, flutter_driver_command, get_widget_tree, stop_app, get_app_logs

### 📚 Reference & Tools

#### **get-mcp-capabilities**
Complete reference guide for MCP tools and how to use them effectively.
- **Use when:** Need to understand available tools, want workflow examples, debugging tool usage
- **Covers:** MCP tools organized by category (Code Analysis, Dependency Management, Runtime Inspection, Testing)
- **Provides:** Tool descriptions, use cases, decision tree for selecting tools, example workflows, checklist
- **Reference:** Consult this when unsure which tool to use for a task

## Decision Framework: When to Use Each Skill

### Starting a New Feature
```
1. Reference load-flutter-instructions for patterns
2. Use pr-prep before final commit
3. Optionally: search-new-flutter-skills for emerging patterns
```

### Setting Up Development Environment
```
1. Use setup-flutter-env (ask questions → analyze → recommend)
2. Follow flutter-setup-guide-skill for MCP configuration
3. Reference get-mcp-capabilities for tool details
```

### Improving Code Quality
```
1. Use pr-prep for comprehensive cleanup
2. Use single-file-test-coverage for low-coverage files
3. Use migrate-to-modern-dart-features for Dart 3+ updates
```

### Testing & Verification
```
1. Use flutter-control-and-screenshot for E2E testing
2. Use run_tests via MCP for unit/widget tests
3. Reference get-mcp-capabilities for runtime tools
```

### Continuous Learning
```

## Proactive Recommendations

Based on your analysis of the developer's task, you should:

✅ **Recommend tools first** - Always check available skills before suggesting approaches
✅ **Explain the "why"** - Help developer understand when and why to use specific skills
✅ **Chain skills together** - Combine skills for complex tasks (e.g., add dependency → test → pr-prep → deploy)
✅ **Stay current** - Regularly reference get-mcp-capabilities to understand tool capabilities
✅ **Suggest discovery** - Proactively mention search-new-flutter-skills for learning opportunities

### Example Recommendations

> "I recommend using **flutter-control-and-screenshot** to verify the new navigation works correctly, then **pr-prep** before opening the PR."

> "For this performance issue, let's use **load-flutter-instructions** for best practices, then potentially **migrate-to-modern-dart-features** to apply modern patterns."

> "Since you're new to this architecture pattern, let me search with **search-new-flutter-skills** for the latest community recommendations."
